# poly-astro

A polymode for [Astro](https://astro.build) components.

It requires for you to have [web-mode](https://web-mode.org) and [polymode](https://polymode.github.io) installed.

## Known issues

This works ok-ish for most of my use-cases. There's a small issue on which syntax highlighting does not show up until you start editing a specific section, but the mode switching and indentation seems to work without any issues.

## Disclaimer

This is very rough and simple and I'm only using this since I don't have the elisp knowledge to make a proper `astro-mode`.
